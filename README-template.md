## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

HTML structure first, with paper I fragmented the layout and saw approximately how much tags I need and how to nest them.
Then CSS to actually style the structure, by first starting at mobile format and then adapting it as the screen size increases.
Finally added the interactivity with Javascript via the DOM.

### Built with

- HTML5,CSS3 & Javascript
- CSS pseudo-classes, media-queries
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

```html
<h1 dir="rtl">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  pointer-events: none;
  outline: 2px solid hsl(172, 67%, 45%);
}
```
```js
let example = parseFloat(HTMLelement.value);
```

### Continued development

This challenge actually put some light on some aspects of web development that I need to work on, that is : 

-Flexbox(Need to work on vertical flow)
-DOM(some html elements did not actually return what I thought)
-Grid(Know the basic but didnt test it here as I'm not comfortable with it yet)
-More semantics(I know how important this is and I'm really attached to it but when doing challenge I'm more focused on the problem than semantic
but still need to progress)
