## My process

HTML structure first, with paper I fragmented the layout and saw approximately how much tags I need and how to nest them.
Then CSS to actually style the structure, by first starting at mobile format and then adapting it as the screen size increases.
Finally added the interactivity with Javascript via the DOM.

### Built with

- HTML5,CSS3 & Javascript
- CSS pseudo-classes, media-queries
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

```html
<h1 dir="rtl">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  pointer-events: none;
  outline: 2px solid hsl(172, 67%, 45%);
}
```
```js
let example = parseFloat(HTMLelement.value);
```

### Continued development

This challenge actually put some light on some aspects of web development that I need to work on, that is : 

-Flexbox(Need to work on vertical flow)
-DOM(some html elements did not actually return what I thought)
-Grid(Know the basic but didnt test it here as I'm not comfortable with it yet)
-More semantics(I know how important this is and I'm really attached to it but when doing challenge I'm more focused on the problem than semantic
but still need to progress)
